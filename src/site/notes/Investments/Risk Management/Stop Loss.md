A **Stop Loss** is an order placed with a broker to automatically sell a security when it reaches a predetermined price. It is designed to **limit potential losses** and protect capital from large adverse price movements.

## Purpose

- Protects the investor or trader from significant losses.
    
- Enforces discipline by removing emotional decision-making during volatile markets.
    
- Helps maintain consistent risk levels across trades or positions.

## Mechanics

- Set a price below the current market price for long positions (or above for short positions).
    
- Can be **fixed (static)** or **trailing**, adjusting automatically as the price moves favorably.
    
- Executed as a market order once the trigger price is hit.
