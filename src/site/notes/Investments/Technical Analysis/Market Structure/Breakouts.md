A **Breakout** occurs when the price moves decisively beyond a key **support** or **resistance** level (see: [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Charts/Chart Patterns/Support and Resistances\|Support and Resistances]]), often accompanied by increased volume. Breakouts can signal the start of a new trend or continuation of an existing one.

## Key Concepts

- Breakouts indicate a shift in market sentiment.
    
- Can occur in [[Investments/Glossary/Trends\|Trends]] or in sideways/range-bound markets.
    
- Volume confirmation increases the probability of a valid breakout.
    
- False breakouts (“fakeouts”) are common and require risk management.
