The **Positive Directional Indicator** shows the strength of bullish price movement.

- Calculated from the difference between today’s high and yesterday’s high (when positive).
    
- Higher values = stronger buying pressure.
    
- Used together with [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/-DI\|-DI]] and [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/ADX\|ADX]] to measure market direction.
    
- When [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/+DI\|+DI]] is above [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/-DI\|-DI]], buyers are in control (bullish trend bias).
