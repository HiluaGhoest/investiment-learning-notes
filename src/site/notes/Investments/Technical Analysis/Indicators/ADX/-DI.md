The **Negative Directional Indicator** shows the strength of bearish price movement.

- Calculated from the difference between yesterday’s low and today’s low (when positive).
    
- Higher values = stronger selling pressure.
    
- Used together with [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/+DI\|+DI]] and [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/ADX\|ADX]] to measure market direction.
    
- When [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/-DI\|-DI]] is above [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/+DI\|+DI]], sellers are in control (bearish trend bias).
