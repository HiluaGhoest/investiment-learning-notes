The **ADX (Average Directional Index)** is a trend strength indicator that uses two components: [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/+DI\|+DI]] and [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/-DI\|-DI]].

- [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/+DI\|+DI]] (Positive Directional Indicator) measures bullish pressure (upward movement).
    
- [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/-DI\|-DI]] (Negative Directional Indicator) measures bearish pressure (downward movement).
    

When [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/+DI\|+DI]] is above [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/-DI\|-DI]], buyers are stronger → trend bias to the upside.  
When [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/-DI\|-DI]] is above [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/+DI\|+DI]], sellers are stronger → trend bias to the downside.

The **ADX line itself** does not show direction, only **trend strength**.

- Rising ADX = strengthening trend (either bullish or bearish, depending on which DI is on top).
    
- Falling ADX = weakening trend (possible consolidation or reversal setup).
    

A common threshold is **25**:

- ADX > 25 → strong trend.
    
- ADX < 20 → weak or ranging market.

## Rules of Interpretation

- **Bullish Crossover**  
    When the **[[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/+DI\|+DI]] crosses above the [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/-DI\|-DI]]**, and the ADX is rising → indicates buying strength is dominant → **uptrend**.
    
- **Bearish Crossover**  
    When the **[[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/-DI\|-DI]] crosses above the [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/+DI\|+DI]]**, and the [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/ADX\|ADX]] is rising → indicates selling strength is dominant → **downtrend**.
    
- **Top Signal**  
    When the **[[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/+DI\|+DI]] stays above the [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/-DI\|-DI]]** with a significant gap, and the [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/ADX\|ADX]] declines from high levels → **top signal**.
    
- **Bottom Signal**  
    When the **-DI stays above the +DI** with a considerable gap, and the [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/ADX/ADX\|ADX]] declines from high levels → **bottom signal**.
