**Relative Strength Index (RSI)** is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market.

## Key Points

- RSI values range from 0 to 100.
    
- **Overbought** → RSI above 70 may indicate a potential reversal downward.
    
- **Oversold** → RSI below 30 may indicate a potential reversal upward.
    
- Often used with [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Charts/Chart Patterns/Support and Resistances\|Support and Resistances]] and [[Investments/Glossary/Trends\|Trends]] for confirmation.
