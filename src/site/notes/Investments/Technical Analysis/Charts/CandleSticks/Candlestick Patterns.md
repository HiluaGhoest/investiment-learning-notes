**Candlestick Patterns** are formations created by one or more candlesticks on a chart. They help traders identify potential market reversals, continuations, and overall sentiment in [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Technical Analysis\|Technical Analysis]] and [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Charts/Charts\|Charts]].

## Key Concepts

- Formed on **Candlestick Charts** using **open, high, low, and close** prices.
    
- Patterns can indicate bullish (upward) or bearish (downward) market behavior.
    
- Often used in conjunction with [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Charts/Chart Patterns/Support and Resistances\|Support and Resistances]] and [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Indicators/Indicators\|Indicators]] to confirm signals.

## Common Patterns

- [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Charts/CandleSticks/Doji\|Doji]] → Indicates market indecision; can signal potential reversal when appearing after a strong trend.
    
- [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Charts/CandleSticks/Hammer\|Hammer]] → A bullish reversal pattern with a small body and long lower shadow, typically found at the bottom of a downtrend.
    
- [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Charts/CandleSticks/Engulfing\|Engulfing]] → A reversal pattern where a candlestick fully “engulfs” the previous one; bullish or bearish depending on the direction.
    
- [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Charts/CandleSticks/Morning Star\|Morning Star]] → A three-candle bullish reversal pattern, usually appearing after a downtrend.
