A **Doji** is a candlestick pattern where the **open and close prices are almost equal**, creating a small or nonexistent body. It represents **indecision in the market**.

## Key Points

- Appears after an uptrend or downtrend, potentially signaling a reversal.
    
- The longer the shadows, the stronger the indecision.
    
- Confirmation from the next candlestick is recommended before acting.
