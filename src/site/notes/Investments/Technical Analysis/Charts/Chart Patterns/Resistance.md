**Resistance** is a price level or zone where selling pressure prevents the price from rising further.

---

## Purpose

- Identify potential selling opportunities or profit-taking zones.
    
- Plan stop-loss orders just above resistance in short positions.
    
- Signal areas where the market may reverse downward.

## Mechanics

- Formed when price repeatedly fails to break above the same level.
    
- Stronger resistance often coincides with previous highs, trendlines, or moving averages.
    
- Breaks above resistance can signal a new uptrend.
