**Support** is a price level or zone where demand is strong enough to prevent the price from falling further.

## Purpose

- Identify potential buying opportunities.
    
- Plan stop-loss orders just below support.
    
- Signal areas where the market may reverse upward.

## Mechanics

- Formed when price repeatedly rebounds from the same level.
    
- Stronger support often coincides with previous lows, trendlines, or moving averages.
    
- Breaks below support can signal a new downtrend.
