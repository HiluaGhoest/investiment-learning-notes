**Support and Resistance** are key price levels on a chart where buying or selling pressure tends to emerge, influencing price direction.

---

## Overview

- [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Charts/Chart Patterns/Support\|Support]] → A price level where demand is strong enough to prevent the price from falling further.
    
- [[Investments/Technical Analysis/Charts/Chart Patterns/Resistance\|Resistance]] → A price level where selling pressure is strong enough to prevent the price from rising further.
    
- These levels help traders identify potential entry, exit, and stop-loss points.

## Mechanics

- Support is formed when price repeatedly bounces upward from a level.
    
- Resistance is formed when price repeatedly fails to break above a level.
    
- Breakouts occur when price moves decisively above resistance or below support, often signaling strong momentum.
    
- Can be **horizontal** (static price levels) or **dynamic** (trend-lines, moving averages).

## Uses in Trading

- Plan stop-loss orders just below support or above resistance.
    
- Combine with other indicators (volume, RSI, MACD) for stronger confirmation.
    
- Track trend reversals when support or resistance levels are broken.

## Risks / Limitations

- Support and resistance are not exact; they are zones, not lines.
    
- Can fail in strong trending markets or during high-impact news events.
    
- Requires confirmation from price action, volume, or other indicators for reliability.
