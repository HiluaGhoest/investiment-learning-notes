**Volume** represents the total number of shares, contracts, or units traded for a security during a specific period. It is a key metric in technical analysis, showing the **strength or conviction behind a price movement**.

---

## Purpose

- Confirm trends: high volume validates price moves, low volume signals weak momentum.
    
- Identify potential reversals or breakouts.
    
- Gauge liquidity and ease of entering/exiting positions.
    
- Detect accumulation or distribution by large market participants.

## Mechanics

- Measured per time period (daily, hourly, intraday).
    
- Often visualized as bars under price charts.
    
- Can be combined with indicators like **Volume Moving Average**, **OBV (On-Balance Volume)**, or **Volume Profile**.

## Interpretation

- **Rising price + rising volume** → strong bullish signal.
    
- **Rising price + falling volume** → weak rally, possible reversal.
    
- **Falling price + rising volume** → strong bearish pressure.
    
- **Falling price + falling volume** → weak selling, possible bottoming.

## Risks / Limitations

- Volume alone cannot predict direction; must be used with price action or other indicators.
    
- Sudden spikes can be misleading (news, block trades).
    
- Less reliable in thinly traded securities with low liquidity.
